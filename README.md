# campus-life-super-app
## My campus super life app is for students. This is supposed to be a helpful campus resouce that involves things like event information and live campus updates. It is interactive and supposed to be helpful.
## In this project I used custom css, bootstrap, Instatus API, Github, and semantic HTML5
## To use this you could go to the deployed link and navigate through the site. 
## In this website you can use the navigation menu to go ot the idfferent pages. The load updates button is for getting live campus alerts. Finally, you can follow the layout for finding what you might need.
## Future improvements could include things like weather and maps. I'm sure someone more advanced could add some pretty cool stuff as well like better graphics that aren't just pictures or something.
